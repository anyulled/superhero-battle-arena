# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2026-03-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project so that future developers (and AI agents) understand the rationale behind certain implementations, patterns, and boundaries.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: <http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions>.

We will store these records in the `docs/adr` directory.

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. Future decisions will have an official place to be registered and referenced.
