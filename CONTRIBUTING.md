# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Superhero Battle Arena!

## Document Size Guidelines

To maintain readability and ease of review, please follow these documentation guidelines:

- **Keep it modular:** Break down large concepts into smaller, logically focused documents (e.g., separate files in the `docs/` directory) rather than maintaining one massive `.md` file.
- **Concise descriptions:** Be clear and to the point.
- **Link resources:** Reference other documents or external standards where applicable, rather than duplicating information.

## CI Guidelines

Ensure that your code is formatted correctly, passes all tests (including property fuzz testing), and does not introduce unresolved `TODO`s or `FIXME`s without good reason (as the GitHub Actions workflow checks for them).
