## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please do NOT report it by creating a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately via GitHub Security Advisories if available for this repository, or by contacting the maintainer directly at `@anyulled`.

We will work to assess the vulnerability and, if confirmed, issue a patch and a public security advisory detailing the flaw and providing mitigation steps.
